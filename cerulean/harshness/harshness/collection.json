  "description": "The Harshness Index generates harshness maps based on wave height, sea\nice concentration, and iceberg density data. The user can set the\nmagnitude of each variable that is considered 'harsh' and the weight\nthat is given the variable.\n\nA harshness/attractiveness index is a single parameter which combines\nvarious data to provide an overall measure of the environmental\nharshness or attractiveness of a region. In general, the index is given\nby the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"media/image1.emf\" style=\"width:6.5in;height:0.47014in\" />Where:\n\n- V<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> variable\n\n- W<sub>i</sub> is the weight assigned to the nth variable.\n  <img src=\"media/image2.emf\" style=\"width:1.26668in;height:0.48214in\" />\n\n- N<sub>i</sub> is the normalization factor for the i<sup>th</sup>\n  variable – typically the largest expected value of V<sub>i</sub>.\n\nThe default harshness index used in the CIF is the Fleming-Drover\nHarshness Index which takes into account:\n\n- Mean annual number of days with a sea ice concentration greater than\n  six-tenths (C)\n\n- Mean annual number of days with a significant wave height greater than\n  four meters (W)\n\n- Mean annual open-water iceberg areal density (D)\n\nValues for these parameters are normalized before incorporating them\ninto the Harshness Index calculation. In the cases of pack ice and\nwaves, the numbers of days exceeding the criteria were divided by 350\nand 110, respectively. These values represent the approximate maximum\nvalues expected. For iceberg density, the values were normalized (on\nscale of 0 to 10) by calculating the logarithm of the iceberg density as\nfollows:\n\n- For iceberg density of -6 (log of 10<sup>-6</sup> km<sup>-2</sup>) or\n  lower, a value of 0\n\n- For iceberg density of -1 (log of 10<sup>-1</sup> km<sup>-2</sup>), a\n  value of 10\n\n- Otherwise, a linear scaling between 0 and 10\n\nThe Fleming-Drover Harshness Index is given by the formula when:\n\n- V<sub>1</sub> is the average number of days per year with a sea ice\n  concentration \\> 60%\n\n- V<sub>2</sub> is the average number of days per year with a\n  significant wave height \\> 4 metres\n\n- V<sub>3</sub> is the average annual iceberg density (number of\n  icebergs per 100 km<sup>2</sup>)\n\n- W<sub>1</sub> is 6\n\n- W<sub>2</sub> is 2.5\n\n- W<sub>3</sub> is 1.5\n\n- N<sub>1</sub> is 350\n\n- N<sub>2</sub> is 110\n\n- N<sub>3</sub> is (12 + 2\\*log<sub>10</sub>(V<sub>3</sub>))\n\n- The iceberg density is within the given range\n\nThe harshness/attractiveness index can be customized to use other\nvariables and equations.\n\n<img src=\"media/image3.emf\" style=\"width:6.5in;height:0.53542in\" />\n",
